This is your Gods Unchained Assistant and still under development

## Features (need helps):
Priority highest to lowest

- [x] Get Player Decks
- [x] Get Opponent Decks
- [ ] Need some helps from UI expert to make the app looks like a killer app ;)
- [ ] Show remaining cards for both player (by remaining cards, it means those cards do not enter the boards)
- [ ] Implement CI/CD for testing/release prebuilt app for new version
- [ ] Get Win rate overall for both player
- [ ] Handle error when sometimes the decks did not load successfully (due to API problems)
- [ ] Center event/crash logging
- [ ] Handle new users (see file data.txt), due to cost problem thus I am not using database at the moment
- [ ] Mac OS support (I do not have a lot of time this moment)
- [ ] For some cards like `Deuteria, Manashard Mage` it will add another cards to player's deck

## Technology:
- Electron
- GuDecks and Gods Unchained API
- Handle realtime communication between render/main process
- Handle reading and parse large log files
- Jquery (not so crazy or scary)
- I wish I could add more :)
